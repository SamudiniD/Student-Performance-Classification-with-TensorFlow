# Student-Performance-Classification-with-TensorFlow
## Description
This project aims to classify student performance into three categories: Low, Middle, and High, using a tabular dataset. The project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a neural network, followed by hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner. It implements early stopping to prevent overfitting and optimizes several hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 480 student records with 17 features, including:

Demographic Features: Gender, Nationality, Place of Birth
Academic Features: Educational Stage, Grade Level, Section
Behavioral Features: Raised hand in class, Visited resources, Discussion group participation, etc.
