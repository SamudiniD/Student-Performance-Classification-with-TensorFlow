# Student-Performance-Classification-with-TensorFlow
This project implements a deep learning model to classify student performance into three categories (Low, Middle, High) using a tabular dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset includes demographic, academic, and behavioral features, and the goal is to predict the student's performance class.
